# Code-challenge-ph1

The above project contains answers to a code challange the i took part in, here are the questions: 

# Challenge 1: 
# Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.


# Challenge 2: #
# Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

 
# Challenge 3: 
# Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

# TABLE OF CONTENT.
speeddetector.js is for the second challenge: speed Detector.

index.js is for the first challenge: student Grade Generator.

netsalarycalculator.js is for the third challenge: Net Salary Calculator.

# PROJECT SETUP
# student grade Generator
For student generator the language used is javascript. To use the code, input you own number (between 0 -100) in the let mark variable then run the code to see the grade that will be presented.

# speed Detector 
For speed generator, the language used was also javascript. To use this code, input your own speed in the let speed variable, then run the code to see what speed/note that will be presented.

# net Salary Calculator
For the net salary calculator, the language used is javascript. To use this code, input your own salary and benefits and run the code to see the net salary, deductions and gross salary.
